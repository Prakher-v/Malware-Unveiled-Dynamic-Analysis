This project is focused on performing dynamic analysis on various malware samples to understand their behavior, impact, and interaction with the system. This project involves the dynamic analysis of malware samples using various tools such as VMware, ProcMon, ProcessExplorer, and FakeNet.

#Steps

Step 1:- Run The VMware

![s1](https://github.com/Prakher-v/Malware-Unveiled-Dynamic-Analysis/assets/92503482/76d63578-f29f-46c2-ae75-b4d3dbc1c661)

In the VMWare Copy the Demo Sample file, Unzip the Folder :- (Set 1) in Set 1 open folder 
(1).

Step 2 :- You will see a file with extension (.dat), open that file in (CFF Explorer).

Their you can check the file header, their you can see that file is not a (.dat) file is a 
executable file which is (.exe) , So we found out that our file is a executable file which is a 
malware.

Step 3:- Know Run the ProcMon tool, To see list of all process run on the system.

Then Disable the event capture by clicking on magnifying glass, and then clear existing 
events.

Step 4:- Run the ProcessExplorer tool.

It can provide valuable insight into the processes currently running on a system.

Step 5:- Run the FakeNet tool.

![s7](https://github.com/Prakher-v/Malware-Unveiled-Dynamic-Analysis/assets/92503482/9ef3881d-4a67-4800-a622-50652627fee0)

FakeNet is a tool that aids in the dynamic analysis of malicious software. The tool 
simulates a network so that malware interacting with a remote host continues to run 
allowing the analyst to observe the malware's network activity from within a safe 
environment.

Step 6 :- Run the 1st shot in RegShot Tool

Step 7 :- Rename the sample to Filename .exe.

Know we can be able to see the real file logo and what type of function that file really do 
and made for. Then execute the file and Wait for few minutes for malware behavior.

Step 9 :- Run the 2nd shot in RegShot Tool.

![s9](https://github.com/Prakher-v/Malware-Unveiled-Dynamic-Analysis/assets/92503482/1c145749-f623-486d-ad89-c2edceaa8d1a)

Step 10 :- Press the Compare button to Compare the results of the two shot. 
(Check the ~res.txt file)

Step 10 :- Finally observe the malware behavior in ProcMon, ProcessExplorer andFakeNet.
